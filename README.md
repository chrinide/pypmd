# promolden
A modern version of promolden, a fortran QTAIM/IQA developed at the Quantum Chemistry group of University of Oviedo

The idea is to upload the code step by step, writting tests and carefully debugging all pieces of the code. Thus this repo is still under heavy development. Some python wrapper will be added for easy common tasks and storing info, althought the structure of the code is not thought to be fully exported to python.

For the last we are also working in a python/C version coupled to pyscf, pyaim `https://github.com/cuanto/pyaim`.

Actual done work are stored by the moment in the dev branch

All users interested in collaborations are well received
