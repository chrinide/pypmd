# promolden
A modern version of promolden, a fortran QTAIM/IQA developed at the Quantum Chemistry group of University of Oviedo

The idea is to upload the code step by step, writting tests and carefully debugging all pieces of the code. Thus this repo is still under heavy development. Some python wrapper will be added for easy common tasks and storing info, althought the structure of the code is not thought to be fully exported to python.

* Surface is done and agree with old promolden code
